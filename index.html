        Dear Nisha<br />
        You have no idea how much your letter meant to me,<br />and even more
        how much yOu mean to me.<br />
        Since the day I first met you I know I wanted you. What I didn&#39;t
        know was just how much I would end up loving you. As you said yourself,
        the word love is not enough to describe what we have.<br />
        What we have is special, unique, so incredibly precious, and I will
        defend it at all costs. I live for you Nisha, and I mean it in the
        literal sense of it.<br />
        My life has so much meaning with you in it, and I don&#39;t want to
        imagine a future without you, as the future we can dream of together is
        so beautiful, so full of joy and love.<br /><br />

        When I say that I love you, I mean that I love everything about you,
        every single thing. Every characteristic that makes you, you.
        There&#39;s nothing that scares me, nothing that pushes me away. You are
        stuck with me. And as such you are stuck with me looking, searching
        deeper and deeper into them to find out what&#39;s wrong, and how I can
        help. I will always be there to hold your hand, so let me.<br /><br />

        We have our own vocabulary, which is ours only. Sooner or later
        we&#39;ll have to keep track of all the things that we assign our
        special meaning to. So here I shall start doing that for us.<br /><br />

        You are my lobster Nisha. I am never letting go of you and you will
        always have my entire heart, so please take care of it, as I will take
        care of yours&#8212;it&#39;s the most precious thing I have.<br /><br />

        Now shut off your phone, as this evening is for us only.
